# Environment Variables

The project relies on environment variables stored in a `.env.local` file located at the root of the `Designdeck` directory to manage configurations. Ensure that essential variables such as database connection strings, API keys, or any other sensitive information are properly set up.

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEBLOCKS_PUBLIC_KEY = "*YOUR LIVEBLOCKS API PUBLIC KEY*"
```

Be sure to replace `*YOUR LIVEBLOCKS API PUBLIC KEY*` with your actual LiveBlocks API public key to enable proper integration.

**Note**: Note: Replace `YOUR LIVEBLOCKS API PUBLIC KEY` with your actual key. Sensitive information should not be committed to version control; include the .env files in your project's `gitignore.`

### Getting started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jahnvisahni31/Designdeck.git
```

2. Change to the project directory:

```bash
cd Designdeck
```

3. Install and run client dependencies:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to see the website in action during development.

## Running the Project Locally Using Docker

You can also run DesignDeck locally using Docker by following these steps:

1. Make sure you have Docker installed on your machine.

2. Go to the `docker-compose.yml` file in the root of your project and put your api key in this section:

```bash
  environment:
      NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEBLOCKS_PUBLIC_KEY: your_api_key_goes_here
```

3. To start the application using Docker, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command builds the image and starts the container. You can then access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.
