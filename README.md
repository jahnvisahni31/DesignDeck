## Environment Variables

The project relies on environment variables stored in a `.env.local` file located at the root of the `Designdeck` directory to manage configurations. Ensure that essential variables such as database connection strings, API keys, or any other sensitive information are properly set up.

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEBLOCKS_PUBLIC_KEY = "*YOUR LIVEBLOCKS API PUBLIC KEY*"
```

Be sure to replace `*YOUR LIVEBLOCKS API PUBLIC KEY*` with your actual LiveBlocks API public key to enable proper integration.

**Note**: Note: Replace `YOUR LIVEBLOCKS API PUBLIC KEY` with your actual key. Sensitive information should not be committed to version control; include the .env files in your project's `gitignore.`
